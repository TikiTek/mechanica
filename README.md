Mechanica
============

[![Build All](https://github.com/TikiTek/mechanica/workflows/build_all/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TikiTek/mechanica/actions)

Original Mechanica written in C# with XNA was the first game I ever made. So I decided to rewrite it in C++ with a solid Framework and Editor. But it's still in progress.


Requirements
------------

Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.

Folder Structure
----
| Path					| Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| /library/tools/editor | Editor	  |
| /local/game			| Game		  |
| /content/mechanica	| Assets	  |


First steps
-----------

1. Goto to the project Folder you want to build/run
2. Execute the project generation Batch File
3. Goto 'build' Folder and open the Solution File
