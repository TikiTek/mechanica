============

![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/TikiTek/mechanica/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

The original version of this game was my first game what I've ever made. So I decided to rewrite it in C++ with a solid Framework and Editor. But it is still in progress.


Requirements
------------

Currently is Visual Studio 2017 recommended.

POIs
----
| Path					| Description |

| /library/tools/editor | Editor	  |
| /local/game			| Game		  |
| /content/mechanica	| Assets	  |


First steps
-----------

1. Goto to the project folder you want to build/run
2. Execute the project generation batch-file
3. Goto 'build' folder and open the solution-file
